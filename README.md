## Overview
This project implements an interactive 3D box rendering system using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Users can visualize and manipulate a box in a 3D-like space, allowing for drag-and-drop interactions within the canvas.

## Features
- **Dynamic Box Rendering**: Draws a 3D box based on user-defined dimensions.
- **Draggable Box**: Users can drag the box on the canvas by interacting with specific regions.
- **Geometric Calculations**: Utilizes custom algorithms for vector direction, line intersections, and geometric projections.
